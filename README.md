# selling-categories
Helping two friends understand programming. Program that sort the sellers into four categories based on how many things they've sold. 

## Get started
`npm run dev`

### How it works
Manually type in 
* Name 
* Person number
* District area 
* How many articles the person has sold

After this comes "you want to add another person? yes / no " 

The program will only respond if you type `no` otherwise it takes the answer as a yes. 

If the answer is yes the loop goes on until you respond no. 

When you respond no, the person(s) are categorized into four different levels based on how many articles they've sold.

* Under 50 articles
* From 50 to 99 articles
* From 99 to 199 articles
* Over 200 articles

This will be formatted into a pleasant string that you can see in the terminal right after the program exit. 
Also a new .txt-file named `Information.txt` will be visable with the same content.

If you decide to run the program again the text file will be overwritten.
